# TTS-Bot
## A Discord Text-To-Speech bot written in python.

#### To do list
- [x] Make the bot work
- [ ] Make a queue system so that no messages get skipped
- [ ] Make the channel specific for each server to use tts in instead of the entire server
- [ ] Give each user using the bot a different voice using different language tts bots for voices (toggleable maybe)

## Why?

Got bored. Thought it would be fun. 

## How to use it

Install GTTS, dotenv, Pycord and FFMPEG

```
pip install gtts py-cord python-dotenv ffmpeg
```

In the file named .env, add your bot token.

Run the bot with the command:
```
python3 main.py
```
